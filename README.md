Currently I'm working as Staff SWE @ [Stone](https://www.stone.com.br/) and developing [GerenciPro](https://gerencipro.com.br/). GerenciPro started to aid my wife business and I'm expanding it to help more business owners.

Some fun facts about me:
- I'm `${new Date().getFullYear()} - 1994` years old
- I don't drink coffee :shrug:
- I like jokes and memes. Sometimes I struggle to hold a joke on serious situations.
- I like to play video games
- I have 3 dogs and 2 cats
- I'm the oldest son of my parents
- I have a brother that have the same birthday as me, but 7 years appart
- I have a homeserver and I'm also very excited about self hosting everything. I'll talk way too much about this if you let me.
- Currently I have ~50 containers running on my home server. The most used are: [FreshRSS](about:blank), [Homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/), [ActualBudget](https://actualbudget.org/), [Frigate](https://frigate.video/), [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and [NotaTrack](https://github.com/matheusvellone/NotaTrack)

I've worked with the following technologies:
- Javascript/Typescript
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Kafka
- React
- Docker
- AWS (EC2, ECS, ECR, RDS, SQS, S3, Api Gateway, )
- Datadog
- Puppeteer
- Github Actions
- Terraform
- Figma
- C# (still learning)
- Go (still learning)

And I expect to study/play with some topics in a short future:
- Golang
- Thermal Printers
- mDNS
- Calendar generation, with RRULE
- More smart home stuff, including more automations
- More self hosting stuff
- Building a Kafka CDC by myself
